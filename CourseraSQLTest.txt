Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

SELECT * 
FROM Tables;
	
i. Attribute table = 10.000
ii. Business table = 10.000
iii. Category table = 10.000
iv. Checkin table = 10.000
v. elite_years table = 10.000
vi. friend table = 10.000
vii. hours table = 10.000
viii. photo table = 10.000
ix. review table = 10.000
x. tip table = 10.000
xi. user table = 10.000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.


i. Business = 10000
SELECT Count(distinct id)
FROM business;

ii. Hours = 1562
SELECT Count(distinct business_id)
FROM hours;

iii. Category = 2643
SELECT Count(distinct business_id)
FROM category;

iv. Attribute = 1115
SELECT Count(distinct business_id)
FROM attribute;

v. Review = 10000
SELECT Count(distinct id)
FROM review;
vi. Checkin = 493

SELECT Count(distinct business_id)
FROM checkin;

vii. Photo = 10000
SELECT Count(distinct id)
FROM photo;

viii. Tip = 537 3979
SELECT Count(distinct user_id), Count(distinct business_id)
FROM tip;

ix. User = 10000
SELECT Count(distinct id)
FROM user;

x. Friend = 11
SELECT Count(distinct user_id)
FROM friend;

xi. Elite_years = 2780
SELECT Count(distinct user_id)
FROM elite_years;

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.

	SELECT DISTINCT(id), max(review_count)
FROM user
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY review_count DESC
LIMIT 3; 
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
+------------------------+-------------------+
| id                     | max(review_count) |

| -8lbUNlXVSoXqaRRiHiSNg |              1339 |
+------------------------+-------------------+


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?
	
	SELECT id, SUM(fans), max(review_count)
FROM user
GROUP BY id


	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	It is not a very high correlation, many users have quite a few reviews but very few or no fans. May depend on other factors such as age or the date they joined the app
	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer:
	HATE = 232
	LOVE = 1780
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

HATE
	
SELECT COUNT(text)
FROM review
WHERE lower(text) like '%hate%';						

LOVE 

SELECT COUNT(text)
FROM review
WHERE lower(text) like '%love%';	
	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT DISTINCT(id), Fans
FROM user
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY Fans DESC
LIMIT 10; 
	
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

+------------------------+------+
| id                     | fans |
+------------------------+------+

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	It seems that the distribution of hours does not influence the rating or the number of reviews

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
        The restaurant with 5 stars has more reviews than the others, in the other restaurants there seems to be no correlation between the number of stars and the number of reviews
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
The restaurant that is further away from the others seems to have a higher number of stars
SQL code used for analysis:

	SELECT
business.name
, business.is_open
, category.category
, business.stars
, hours.hours
, business.review_count
, business.postal_code
, business.latitude
, business.longitude
FROM (business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id) inner join hours on hours.business_id = category.business_id
WHERE (business.city = 'Toronto') or (category = 'Restaurants') 
GROUP BY stars;
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
     businesses that are open have more stars
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
     businesses that are open have more reviews
         
SQL code used for analysis:
	SELECT
b.name
, b.is_open
, c.category
, b.stars
, hours.hours
, b.review_count
, b.postal_code
, b.latitude
, b.longitude
FROM (business b inner join category c  on b.id = c.business_id) inner join hours on hours.business_id = c.business_id
WHERE (b.city = 'Toronto') or (category = 'Restaurants') 
GROUP BY b.is_open ;
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         Find the 15 users who most use the words 'hate, I don't like, unpleasant, ugly, far' and their average restaurant rating
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
              user and review data is needed, mainly the text of the reviews             
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
+------------------------+-------+-------+
| id                     | name  | stars |
+------------------------+-------+-------+
| -iFWTEPA84DKWBhGww8EeQ | James |     4 |
| -jSTFDuaDXMrLYvU1KbK5Q | Just  |     4 |
| --Qh8yKWAvIP4V4K8ZPfHA | Dixie |     4 |
+------------------------+-------+-------+
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
	SELECT u.id, u.name, r.stars
FROM user u
INNER JOIN review r ON u.id = r.user_Id
WHERE (r.text LIKE '%hate%') or (r.text LIKE "%don't like%") or (r.text LIKE '%unpleasant%') or (r.text LIKE '%ugly%') or (r.text LIKE '%far%') ;
